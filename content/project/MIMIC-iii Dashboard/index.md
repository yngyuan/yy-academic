The project aims to design and develop a dashboard of the MIMIC-iii dataset for doctors. With the guidance of my supervisors from Dell Medical School, I developed a dashboard application using Cube.js and designed visualization of the MIMIC-iii demo dataset. The application consists of a playground where doctors can try out different graphs with easy drag-and-drop operations, a demo data visualization of various graphs focusing on Sepsis, and a user account system providing customized dashboard for each account. In conclusion, this is a medical data dashboard application of the doctors, by the doctors, and for the doctors.
