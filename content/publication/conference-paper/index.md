# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Platforms like DoorDash and UberEats provide tremendous op- portunities for gig workers. However, the gig workers are under "algorithmic management" and have to face the black-boxed algo- rithms with very limited understanding of how the system operates. Their income are greatly influenced by their delivery time. The gig workers often find themselves spending more time waiting than delivering, which in turn decrease their ratings and threats their chances of getting orders. We dived into the problem by algorithm auditing, conducting survey and having 1 on 1 interviews with users. To address this problem we came up with 3 new interface designs and tested with Dashers using storyboard speed dating to get their feedback.
